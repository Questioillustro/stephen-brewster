  'Hi, I’m Stephen Brewster, better known in some circles as @questioillustro\n' +
  '—a handle that hints at my love for asking big questions and bringing ideas to life, perhaps with a touch of creative flair. By day (and sometimes night), I’m a software engineer with a solid decade of experience under my belt, building systems, solving problems, and taming the wild chaos of code. I thrive on turning complex challenges into elegant solutions, a skill I’ve honed over years of debugging, designing, and dreaming in binary. But my life’s not all screens and syntax—far from it. I’m just as comfortable scaling a rock face or trekking through rugged terrain as I am at a keyboard.\n' +
  'Adventure is my heartbeat. I’ve summited Kilimanjaro, standing at 19,341 feet above sea level, feeling the thin air and the thrill of that final push to Uhuru Peak. I’ve also hiked the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu, a four-day journey through misty Andean mountains, past ancient ruins, and into the breathtaking embrace of the Lost City of the Incas. Those experiences taught me resilience, patience, and the joy of a well-earned view. Closer to home, I’m an avid rock climber—there’s nothing quite like the puzzle of a tough route, the grip of chalk-dusted hands on stone, or the quiet triumph of reaching the top. Whether it’s a crag in the wild or a gym wall, climbing keeps me grounded (ironically) and always hungry for the next ascent.\n' +
  'Back at base camp—aka my house—I share my space with two feline overlords, Atreyu and Falkor, named after the unforgettable heroes from The Neverending Story. Atreyu’s the bold one, always stalking imaginary prey, while Falkor’s my luck dragon, sprawling across the couch with a purr that could melt glaciers. They’re my constant companions, especially when I’m curled up with a good book. I’m a voracious reader of science fiction and fantasy—give me sprawling epics like Dune, mind-bending tales from Philip K. Dick, or the intricate worlds of Brandon Sanderson, and I’m lost for hours. Those stories fuel my imagination, much like the code I write or the routes I climb.\n' +
  'The ‘questioillustro’ part of me suggests I’m not just a doer but a thinker and maybe even a maker. I love exploring life’s big questions—What’s out there? How can we build it? Why does it matter?—and I suspect there’s an illustrative streak in me too, whether it’s sketching out concepts, doodling in the margins of my notebooks, or just picturing the next adventure in vivid detail. I’m a blend of logic and wonder, discipline and daydreams, and I’m always chasing the next summit, be it literal or metaphorical. Stick around—I’ve got stories to tell, code to crack, and peaks to conquer!\n' +
