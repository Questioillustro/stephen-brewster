In an age when the earth still hummed like a string just plucked, a figure emerged from the edges of dusk. Cloaked in a well of darkness, their face was no more than the light flickering of stars at the bottom. They moved through the land like a breath held too long—neither hurried nor lingering, neither seen nor unseen. The people, nestled in their villages of certainty, knew nothing of them. No name was spoken, no origin claimed. They simply *were*, a ripple in the stillness.

The world then was a cradle of calm. Rivers danced gently, hills basked in amber light, and the sky stretched wide and untroubled. Life unfolded as it always had, predictable as the seasons. Yet this stranger saw beyond the surface. Their eyes, hidden beneath twilight’s weave, traced threads of ruin others could not fathom—a sky ready to fracture, waters poised to rage, and ground trembling to split. They saw the end in the beginning, and they acted.

At the valley’s rim, where stone met grass, they began. A single pebble was placed, then another. Days bled into nights, and their hands—steady, relentless—shaped something from nothing. They drew wood from forests that shook, carved stone from jagged cliffs, and twisted ropes from bladed grass. The people, when they chanced upon the work, whispered among themselves. “What purpose drives this here, where nothing is needed?” The figure offered no answer, their gaze fixed on a distance beyond sight.

A structure rose under its labor—an arch of stone and tree, and grass, its span reaching over a field of wheat. It was no ordinary thing. Some called it a wonder, others a curse. Children who brushed its surface spoke of a hum, a pulse that sent them running in fear, yet giggling all the same. The figure toiled on, unheeding, until the work stood complete: a path to nowhere, a marvel of novelty that delighted and confused. 

So it stood for many years, both loved and hated by the villagers over time. A burden said the farmers, a blessing from the gods said the priest, a gift to the children said the parents. Yet no group could gain sway and so it stood in defiance of division as the seasons turned. 

In time the farmers proved true and food became scarce, the children grew hungry, and the parents grew desperate. It's time to tear it down today they declared, we cannot wait another day. It is now two against one, and so priest, step aside.

A wind hissed through the trees, sharp and cold. The earth shuddered, rivers reared like beasts, and the sky turned to ink. By morning, the land was a wound—cracked and bleeding. The people fled, their voices lost to panic, until they reached the valley’s edge. There it loomed: the stranger’s creation, untouched by the chaos, its stones and wood and grass, a quiet defiance. What had seemed a folly now stretched over the maw below, a thread to the future.

Whispers grew into legend: the Silent Wanderer, a presence that drifts through time, appearing when the world teeters unseen. They build where none would think to, their hands weaving futures out of ruin. Who they are—mortal, spirit, or something else—none can say. Only this is certain: when the storm looms and the ground falters, they are there, crafting paths across the void, vanishing before the first thanks can be spoken.
