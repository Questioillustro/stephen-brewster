You wake up in bed, the room is filled with thick smoke. You can't see it, but it chokes you all the same. Fire alarms blare loudly, adrenaline like the bucket of cold water you wish you had, slices your veins. 

What do you do?

1) Grab a blanket and run into your adjoined bathroom. Run water in the tub and breath through the wet blanket.

You wake up in bed, the room is filled with thick smoke. You can’t see it, but it chokes you all the same. Fire alarms blare loudly, adrenaline like the bucket of cold water you wish you had, slices your veins.

Instinct kicks in. You grab the blanket from your bed, wrapping it around yourself as you stumble towards the adjoined bathroom. The smoke is suffocating, but you push through, your mind focused on survival. You reach the bathroom and slam the door shut behind you, hoping to buy yourself some time.

You turn on the faucet, letting the water run into the tub. The sound of the rushing water is a small comfort amidst the chaos. You soak the blanket, draping it over your head and shoulders. The wet fabric provides a barrier against the smoke, allowing you to take shallow breaths.

You crouch by the tub, the cool water splashing over your hands. The minutes stretch on, each one feeling like an eternity. You can hear the distant wail of sirens, a beacon of hope in the darkness. You cling to the thought of rescue, knowing that help is on the way.

2) Open the window and attempt to jump from the third story.

3) Try the door, test the handle for temperature.
